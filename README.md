# Erasys JavaScript Trial Task
Users are very important on ROMEO. That's why we want you to implement an app that shows a list of users. We have included a simple server with two API endpoints that give you the required data.

## Requirements
- Create a JavaScript app (you can use your favorite `npm` packages and frameworks) that shows the results in a layout similar to the following screenshot:
![](./data/mockup.jpg)

- Make sure that a single item shows the following data:
  - Username
  - Age
  - Image
  - Location and distance
  - Headline
  - Relative last login time (e.g. 6 minutes ago)

  *The screenshot above is just an illustration of what we have in mind. Feel free to use it as a starting point, or implement your own design.*

- The app should work on all screen sizes
- Include your `git` history when you send us your code

## Server
1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. The API is available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## API description
### `GET /api/search?length=32`
### `GET /api/search?length=32&sorting=[DISTANCE|ACTIVITY]`
Returns a list of user profiles with some basic information.

#### Example output
```javascript
{
  "cursors": {
    "after": (string)
  },
  "total": (number),
  "items": [{
    "id": (string),
    "name": (string),
    "picture": {
      "comment": (string),
      "url": (string)
    },
    ...
  }]
}
```

### `/api/profiles?ids=_id1_&ids=_id2_&ids=...`
Returns an array of detailed user data matching the given ids.

#### Example output
```javascript
[
  {
    "id": (string),
    "location": {
      "name": (string),
      "distance": (number)
    },
    "headline": (string),
    "personal": {
      "age": (number),
      ...
    },
    "sexual": {
      "anal_position": (string),
      ...
    },

    {
      "id": (string),
      ...
    }
]
```

Please note: Whilst the project does not contain any explicit content, it does use images
that might draw unwanted attention in some countries. If you are worried about running this
project, you can use `npm run safe-start` to replace socially contentious content with something
less so.
